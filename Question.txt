Title: Library Management System – Scenario-Based Assignment
Instructions:
•	Follow each task exactly as specified.
•	Show required proofs and explanations after each task.
•	Target platform: .NET 10.
Task 1: Abstract Class & Abstract Methods Requirements:
•	Create one abstract base class LibraryItem with exactly 3 properties: Title, Author, ItemID.
•	Define exactly 2 abstract methods:
•	Display item details.
•	Calculate late fee.
•	Create two concrete classes: Book, Magazine.
•	Both must inherit LibraryItem and override both abstract methods.
•	Late fee rules:
•	Book: 1 unit/day.
•	Magazine: 0.5 units/day. Proof:
•	Create 1 Book and 1 Magazine.
•	Display Title, Author, ItemID, Late fee for exactly 3 days. Expected Output:
•	Item Type: Book
•	Title: C# Fundamentals
•	Author: John Doe
•	Item ID: 101
•	Late Fee for 3 days: 3.0
•	Item Type: Magazine
•	Title: Tech Today
•	Author: Jane Doe
•	Item ID: 201
•	Late Fee for 3 days: 1.5 Concept Confirmation:
•	Book late fee = 3 × 1 = 3.0
•	Magazine late fee = 3 × 0.5 = 1.5
Task 2: Interfaces & Multiple Inheritance Requirements:
•	Create IReservable with one reserve method.
•	Create INotifiable with one method that accepts a message.
•	Book must implement both and provide implementations. Proof:
•	Call reservation and notification methods.
•	Output must indicate reservation success and notification message sent. Expected Output:
•	Book reserved successfully.
•	Notification sent: Your reserved book is ready for pickup.
Task 3: Dynamic Polymorphism Requirements:
•	Create one collection of LibraryItem.
•	Add 1 Book and 1 Magazine.
•	Use a loop accessing items via LibraryItem type only. Proof:
•	Correct DisplayItemDetails() executes for each runtime type. Mandatory Explanation (1–2 lines):
•	The method executed depends on the object type at runtime, not the reference type. Expected Output:
•	Item Type: Book
•	Title: C# Fundamentals
•	Author: John Doe
•	Item ID: 101
•	Item Type: Magazine
•	Title: Tech Today
•	Author: Jane Doe
•	Item ID: 201
Task 4: Explicit Interface Implementation Requirements:
•	Modify Book to explicitly implement IReservable and INotifiable.
•	Prevent direct calls to these methods via Book object. Proof:
•	Call via IReservable and INotifiable references only. Mandatory Explanation (1 sentence):
•	Explicit implementation prevents direct access and exposes functionality only through interfaces. Expected Output:
•	Book reserved successfully.
•	Notification: Please return the book on time.
Task 5: Namespaces & Nested Namespaces Requirements:
•	Main namespace: LibrarySystem.
•	Nested namespaces: Items, Users.
•	Place Book and Magazine in Items; place Member in Users.
•	Create one namespace alias for LibrarySystem.Items. Proof:
•	Use alias to create Book and Magazine objects. Mandatory Explanations (2 points):
•	Nested namespaces organize large projects logically.
•	Aliases reduce long namespace references and improve readability. Expected Proof:
•	Successful object creation using alias.
Task 6: Partial & Static Classes Requirements:
•	Create partial class LibraryAnalytics split into two parts.
•	Include:
•	One static property tracking total borrowed items.
•	One static method to display analytics. Proof:
•	Increase borrowed count; display total borrowed items. Mandatory Explanation (1 line):
•	Static members store system-wide data shared across all objects. Expected Output:
•	Total Items Borrowed: 5
Task 7: Enumerations (Enums) Requirements:
•	Enum UserRole: Admin, Librarian, Member.
•	Enum ItemStatus: Available, Borrowed, Reserved, Lost.
•	Assign a role to a user and a status to a library item. Proof:
•	Display user role and item status. Mandatory Explanation (1 sentence):
•	Enums prevent invalid values and improve code readability. Expected Output:
•	User Role: Member
•	Item Status: Borrowed
Bonus Task: Advanced Design Requirements:
•	Modify notification logic by role:
•	Admin → system alert.
•	Member → borrowing update.
•	Add new item type EBook:
•	Inherits LibraryItem.
•	Has one digital-specific behavior. Proof:
•	Demonstrate role-based notification difference.
•	Demonstrate EBook behavior execution. Expected Output:
•	Admin Alert: System maintenance scheduled.
•	Member Notification: Your borrowed item is due tomorrow.
•	eBook Behavior Output: eBook downloaded successfully.
Final Evaluation Checklist (Faculty)
•	Abstraction: Different late fee outputs.
•	Interfaces: Reservation + Notification.
•	Polymorphism: Correct runtime method calls.
•	Explicit Interface: Interface-only access.
•	Namespaces: Alias usage.
•	Static: Shared analytics.
•	Enums: Controlled roles/status.
•	Design Quality: Bonus task.
